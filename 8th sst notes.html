  <!-- Chapter 1: How, When, and Where -->
  <section id="chapter-1">
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter 1: How, When, and Where</h2>
      <p>This chapter explains how history is studied, classified, and why dates are important. It teaches how British historians divided Indian history into Hindu, Muslim, and British periods and why this classification is misleading.</p>
      <h3>Key Points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>History helps us understand changes over time, like administration, economy, and society.</li>
        <li>The importance of dates is linked to key events like battles, laws, or policies.</li>
        <li>Sources of history include official records, surveys, diaries, newspapers, and autobiographies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>British officials were obsessed with documentation. They set up record rooms and archives, making it possible for historians to access detailed data today. Surveys like census, revenue settlements, and maps helped British control India but also left rich sources for historians.</p>

  <!-- Chapter 2: From Trade to Territory -->
  <section id="chapter-2">
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter 2: From Trade to Territory</h2>
      <p>This chapter explains how the British East India Company transformed from traders into rulers between the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
      <h3>Key Points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>East India Company got trading rights after the 1600s but slowly expanded political power through battles like Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764).</li>
        <li>Strategies like ‚Äúsubsidiary alliance‚Äù forced Indian rulers to accept British control without open warfare.</li>
        <li>Major territories annexed included Bengal, Awadh, Mysore, and Punjab.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Company used clever diplomacy, military superiority, and economic pressure. They defeated powerful rulers like Tipu Sultan and subdued the Marathas. The British also reorganized revenue systems, judiciary, and administration.</p>

  <!-- Chapter 3: Ruling the Countryside -->
  <section id="chapter-3">
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter 3: Ruling the Countryside</h2>
      <p>This chapter covers how the British controlled Indian agriculture and revenue.</p>
      <h3>Key Points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Permanent Settlement in Bengal fixed land revenues, making zamindars powerful but exploitative.</li>
        <li>Mahalwari and Ryotwari systems were introduced in north and south India respectively.</li>
        <li>Commercial crops like indigo and cotton were forced on farmers, leading to famines and revolts like the Indigo Rebellion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The British aim was profit. They transformed Indian agriculture into an export-oriented system, which weakened food security and created deep rural distress. Their policies helped British industries but destroyed India‚Äôs village economy.</p>

  <section id="chapter-4">
    <div class="chapter">
      <h2>Chapter 4: Tribals, Dikus and the Vision of a Golden Age</h2>
      <p>Tribal societies were affected by British colonial policies, forest laws, and interference by outsiders called ‚ÄòDikus.‚Äô</p>
      <h3>Key Points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tribal life depended on forests, shifting cultivation, and barter trade.</li>
        <li>British forest policies restricted access, while moneylenders and traders exploited tribals.</li>
        <li>Leaders like Birsa Munda envisioned a return to a ‚ÄòGolden Age‚Äô and led revolts against exploitation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This chapter highlights the disruption of traditional economies, cultural suppression, and resistance movements. It shows how British rule reshaped even the most remote communities.</p>

  <section id="chapter-5">
    <div class="chapter">

      <p>The Revolt of 1857 was India‚Äôs first major rebellion against British rule. It began as a military mutiny and spread across northern India.</p>

        <li>Causes included political annexation, economic exploitation, military grievances, and religious interference.</li>

    <div class="chapter">

        <li>Calcutta became the capital, with Western architecture and municipal reforms.</li>

        <li>Orientalists supported traditional learning; Anglicists wanted English-based modern education.</li>
        <li>Education was seen as a tool to create obedient clerks and instill Western values.</li>
        <li>Indian reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy supported modern education but criticized the neglect of Indian knowledge systems.</li>
      </ul>
